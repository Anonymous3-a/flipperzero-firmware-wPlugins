### New changes
* If you have copied apps into `apps` folder - remove `apps` folder on your microSD before installing this release to avoid issues!
* SubGHz: (Bug that I decided to keep as a feature) You can change default button (Ok) for remote by holding custom button and pressing back at same time (same can be used to restore your button if you changed it accidentally) - Be careful, it might be unstable, I will make proper option to change button in next releases
* SubGHz: Fixes for custom button bugs in SubGHz Remote app
* SubGHz: Add alutech table to enviroment alloc and free
* Plugins: Update **TOTP (Authenticator)** [(by akopachov)](https://github.com/akopachov/flipper-zero_authenticator)
* Plugins: Update **UART Terminal** [(by cool4uma)](https://github.com/cool4uma/UART_Terminal/tree/main)
* OFW: Deep Sleep Idle - **Improves battery usage!!!**

* OFW: FuriHal: fix gpio naming and add explicit pulls for vibro, speaker and ir_tx -> **Breaking API change, api was changed from 20.x to 21.x** 
**(this will make your manually copied plugins not work, update them in same way you installed them, or delete `apps` folder and then install firmware, if you using extra pack builds (with `e` in version) all apps in _Extra will be updated automatically)**

**Note: To avoid issues with .dfu, prefer installing using .tgz with qFlipper, web updater or by self update package, all needed assets will be installed**

**Recommended option - Web Updater**

What means `n` or `e` in - `flipper-z-f7-update-(version)(n / e).tgz` ? - `n` means this build comes without our custom animations, only official flipper animations, 
`e` means build has extra apps pack preinstalled

Self-update package (update from microSD) - `flipper-z-f7-update-(version).zip` or download `.tgz` for mobile app / qFlipper
