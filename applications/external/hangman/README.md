# The game "Gallows" ("Balda")
The first Russian-language program for Flipper Zero.

The rules are very simple â€“ "Flipper" guesses a word, you have to guess it by choosing letters. If a letter occurs, it will be drawn at that position or positions, where it occurs in the word, if not, then part of the "gallows" will be drawn. If the "gallows" is drawn in full, you lose, if you guess the word earlier, you win.
